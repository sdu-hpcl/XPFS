{"name":"XPFS","tagline":"","body":"#XPFS\r\n\r\n*  A new method to search PROSITE profile on XEON Phi.\r\n\r\n##Introduction\r\n* XPFS is a high performance database searching method based on the Intel(R) MIC platform. We have used a two-level parallelization scheme: the thread level coarse-grained and VPU level fine-grained parallelism to implement our algorithm. We gain 3 times faster than PFSearchV3 on the Xeon Phi 7110p.\r\n\r\n##Installation and Usage\r\n* Query profiles and database are needed to run XPFS. Profiles can be downloaded at [ftp://lausanne.isb-sib.ch/pub/software/unix/pftools/pftoolsV3/pftoolsV3.PROSITE.tar.gz]. And databse should be in FASTA format.\r\n\r\n#### Run XPFS \r\n  * `./XPFS -t nCpus -T nMics <queryProfile> <database>` \r\n  * nCPUs : number of cpu thread; nMICs : number of Xeon Phi cards (Currently only one card supported)\r\n  * for more details, you can run :\r\n  * `./XPFS -h`\r\n\r\n\r\n##Reference\r\n\r\n##Authors and Contributors\r\n* Weiguo Liu is the corresponding author.\r\n\r\n##Support or Contact\r\n* If you have any questions, please contact: Weiguo,Liu ( weiguo.liu@sdu.edu.cn).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
